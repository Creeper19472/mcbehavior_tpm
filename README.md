# Minecraft Behavior Pack: the True Peaceful Mode (TPM) README

[![CI](https://github.com/Creeper19472/mcbehavior_tpm/actions/workflows/auto-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Creeper19472/mcbehavior_tpm/actions/workflows/auto-release.yml)

## Introduction
This is an Minecraft addon pack that provides a new gameplay
named "the True Peaceful Mode". It allows the player to coexist
peacefully with some monsters, and from this, a new way of 
playing is derived.

**Note:** Still in development.

## Feature
Some of the things that have been developed or will be added in
the future that you can see in this behavior pack:

- Zombies (excluding zombie villagers), skeletons, and creepers
no longer actively attack players
- Creepers can be attracted and trusted with gunpowder and TNT
- Some monsters will actively attack wardens to protect their 
own groups from excessive damage
- Zombies, skeletons and creepers can open doors (meaning villager 
doors are more useless & zombies still attack villagers)
- Zombies behave smarter, at least as smart as skeletons
- Creeper's attack method is more terrible (if you try to attack 
it, but how can you bear it)
- And more

## Installation
Just download the source code and install it as usual. 

**Or** download the .mcaddon pack and double-click it... Don't 
worry, it's simple for you to build it, and we have attached 
the click-to-run package files in the releases.

## Development
Because this add-on is still in the early stages of development, 
a lot of content has yet to be implemented. Refer to RELEASE_NOTES.md
for each update description.
